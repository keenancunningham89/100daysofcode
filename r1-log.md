# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Keenan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [september, 8 , 2018].
day 1  9/8/18:
I actually used github for the first time. Not from the console but I will worry about that later. I started back on a python project that I started to mostly help me become more comfortable with functions. The last thing I wanted to get the interactive dictionary working. I think I'm OK with where I am with it now. I like python but I'm going to focus more on web development. With my background being in plumbing and no college whatsoever I need to conciser what I need to do if I do eventually want to be able to apply these skills in a actual job. I think in my position web development is the practical way to go. Later, I finished the  freecodecamp HTML intro course.
